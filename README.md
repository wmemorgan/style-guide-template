# UI Style Guide

## Overview
The style guide serves as a design and development tool that brings cohesion to a digital product's user interface and experience. At it's core the guide:
  * Record all of the design elements and interactions that occur within a product
  * List crucial UI components such as buttons, typography, color, navigation menus, etc.
  * Contain live elements and code snippets for developers to reference and use
